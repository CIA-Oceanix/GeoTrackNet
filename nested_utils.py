  """Executes map_fn on every element in a (potentially) nested structure.

  Args:
    map_fn: A callable to execute on each element in 'nested'.
    nested: A potentially nested combination of sequence objects. Sequence
      objects include tuples, lists, namedtuples, and all subclasses of
      collections.Sequence except strings. See nest.is_sequence for details.
      For example [1, ('hello', 4.3)] is a nested structure containing elements
      1, 'hello', and 4.3.
  Returns:
    out_structure: A potentially nested combination of sequence objects with the
      same structure as the 'nested' input argument. out_structure
      contains the result of applying map_fn to each element in 'nested'. For
      example map_nested(lambda x: x+1, [1, (3, 4.3)]) returns [2, (4, 5.3)].

      need to have the same rank, but their rank must not be dynamic.
    multiples: A python list of ints indicating how to tile each Tensor
      in 'tensors'. Similar to the 'multiples' argument to tf.tile.
  Returns:
    tiled_tensors: A potentially nested tuple or list of Tensors with the same
      structure as the 'tensors' input argument. Contains the result of
      applying tf.tile to each Tensor in 'tensors'. When the rank of a Tensor
      in 'tensors' is greater than the length of multiples, multiples is padded
      at the end with 1s. For example when tiling a 4-dimensional Tensor with
      multiples [3, 4], multiples would be padded to [3, 4, 1, 1] before tiling.
