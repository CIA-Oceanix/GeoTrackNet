  """Implementation of a Variational Recurrent Neural Network (VRNN).

  Introduced in "A Recurrent Latent Variable Model for Sequential data"
  by Chung et al. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02216.pdf.

  The VRNN is a sequence model similar to an RNN that uses stochastic latent
  variables to improve its representational power. It can be thought of as a
  sequential analogue to the variational auto-encoder (VAE).

  The VRNN has a deterministic RNN as its backbone, represented by the
  sequence of RNN hidden states h_t. At each timestep, the RNN hidden state h_t
  is conditioned on the previous sequence element, x_{t-1}, as well as the
  latent state from the previous timestep, z_{t-1}.

  In this implementation of the VRNN the latent state z_t is Gaussian. The
  model's prior over z_t is distributed as Normal(mu_t, diag(sigma_t^2)) where
  mu_t and sigma_t are the mean and standard deviation output from a fully
  connected network that accepts the rnn hidden state h_t as input.

  The approximate posterior (also known as q or the encoder in the VAE
  framework) is similar to the prior except that it is conditioned on the
  current target, x_t, as well as h_t via a fully connected network.

  This implementation uses the 'res_q' parameterization of the approximate
  posterior, meaning that instead of directly predicting the mean of z_t, the
  approximate posterior predicts the 'residual' from the prior's mean. This is
  explored more in section 3.3 of https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.07571.pdf.

  During training, the latent state z_t is sampled from the approximate
  posterior and the reparameterization trick is used to provide low-variance
  gradients.

  The generative distribution p(x_t|z_t, h_t) is conditioned on the latent state
  z_t as well as the current RNN hidden state h_t via a fully connected network.

  To increase the modeling power of the VRNN, two additional networks are
  used to extract features from the data and the latent state. Those networks
  are called data_feat_extractor and latent_feat_extractor respectively.

  There are a few differences between this exposition and the paper.
  First, the indexing scheme for h_t is different than the paper's -- what the
  paper calls h_t we call h_{t+1}. This is the same notation used by Fraccaro
  et al. to describe the VRNN in the paper linked above. Also, the VRNN paper
  uses VAE terminology to refer to the different internal networks, so it
  refers to the approximate posterior as the encoder and the generative
  distribution as the decoder. This implementation also renamed the functions
  phi_x and phi_z in the paper to data_feat_extractor and latent_feat_extractor.
